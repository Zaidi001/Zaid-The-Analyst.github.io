									<h2>ABOUT ME <br />
										</a></h2>
									<p>Growing up in a rural setting, I was captivated by our home's first computer. By eleven, I had mastered Microsoft Office and was intrigued by stories of tech pioneers like Bill Gates. This early passion prompted me to delve into programming during my sophomore year, culminating in winning a National Robotics Competition in Pakistan during my junior year.<br><br>

										Although I initially pursued civil engineering in college due to familial expectations, my heart remained with programming. After graduation, I resolutely shifted towards Artificial Intelligence. Overcoming numerous challenges, including multiple visa rejections and the attempting rigorous GRE exam multiple times (328/340 latest score), I was finally accepted into the University at Buffalo's Robotics Master's program.<br><br>
										
										I have expertise in <strong>Python, Linux Bash, SQL</strong> and am proficient with machine learning tools such as <strong>PyTorch, Pyspark, Keras, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Spacy, NLTK, and Hugging Face</strong>. My Data Science toolkit includes <strong>Tableau, PowerBI, Excel & AWS Services</strong> especially <strong>S3</strong>  , I'm well-versed in deployment and version control with <strong>Heroku , Git and GitHub</strong> and I'm adept at web application deployment using <strong>Flask</strong> . <br><br> With this blend of passion and expertise, I'm eager to innovate in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Robotics.<br></p>

								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ETL.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>I've tackled several data engineering projects. I made a Twitter Scrapper that tracks what notable figures, like Donald Trump, talk about.  I also set up a tool by scrapping data from Amazon to alert me about price drops for a product via email. Plus, I've fine-tuned data using SQL to get it ready for analysis. Check out the details below.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I've worked on some interesting SQL projects. I looked at data about the environment to see important patterns. I also checked out data from Playstore Apps to see what's popular and what's not. Another project had me comparing data from Youtube and Spotify to understand which songs people like. Plus, I made a dashboard using data about Covid-19 to help people see the current situation. You can learn more about all these projects below.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Tableau.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I've created several dashboards using Tableau to make complex data easy to understand. My HR analytics dashboard provides insights into employee data. With the Covid-19 Dashboard, I visualized the pandemic's spread and impact, making it easier for viewers to grasp the situation. The Customer Complaint Dashboard pinpoints areas of improvement by visualizing customer feedback. Lastly, my AirBnB Dashboard showcases rental trends, assisting both hosts and travelers in their decisions. Check out these projects for a deeper dive!									</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/excel.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In my Excel journey, I've focused on translating raw data into meaningful insights. I analyzed bike sales, converting numbers into a comprehensive dashboard that tracks sales trends and key performance metrics. Similarly, for the e-commerce sector, I delved deep into sales data to construct a dashboard that highlights purchase behaviors, top-selling products, and sales trajectories. My use of Excel goes beyond basic functions, leveraging its full potential to visualize and understand complex datasets. Dive into these projects to see the magic of Excel in action!</p>

									<p>In my Web and App Design journey, I've prioritized user experience and innovation. My portfolio website showcases my dedication and skills, designed for clarity and engagement. Harnessing AI, I've launched a Facial Emotion Recognition app on Heroku, which interprets human emotions visually. Similarly, my Speech Emotion Recognition tool decodes emotions from voice. To tap into social data, I devised a Twitter Scraper Flask app, extracting user insights and tracking trends. Each project embodies my commitment to merging design with functionality.
